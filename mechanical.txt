Mechanical
=======

Material
--------
We chose to make our quadcopter out of corrugated cardboard. We chose to use cardboard because it is a cheap, lightweight material. Because we are using cardboard, we decided to employ a lasercutter to cut out our frame. With these two technologies we can easily iterate and prototype our frame design. 

The one downfall to corrugated cardboard is its strength. In certain directions, with the corrugations, cardboard is incredibly weak. In the other directions though it is quite strong. When designing parts we constantly have to think about this.


Frame Design
------------

The frame consists of three sections: a center base for the control board and other electronits, four arms, and a motor mounting box at the end of each arm. We have built two prototypes for our frame. The first one was experimental and lacked many of the necessary componenents as well as having some issues. The changes we made included making the cardboard slots smaller (we originally measured cardboard to be 5mm, but by going back and measuring realized that it was actually 4.1mm thick), that we needed a solid cardboard sheet with guide holes to mount the motors, adding slots for the wiring to run through, adding legs, and adding additional shelves for electronics.

Props
-----
We have four 8 inch, three-blade props with 4 inch pitch. There will be two counter-rotating and two regularly rotating props. This will balance out the rotation of the copter. We got these specific props because of their low pitch and because they have three blades, which maximizes our lift, and are optimized for helicopter-like vehicles.

We have wire frames coming out of the cardboard arms of the quadcopter that are bent around the outside of the propellors to make our quadcopter both more durable if it runs into walls or other objects, and as a safety feature for those in the vicinity when the quadcopter is flying.

We are attaching the props to the quadcopter using screw clamp that is tightened by tightening a nut. Originally, we press fit these, but realized that press fits have a lot of drawbacks including strength and ability to remove, so we decided to use the screw clamps instead.

Prototyping
-----------
A main goal in our design was to be able to quickly prototype our quadcopter. During the course of the project we made 3 different frames.

###Prototype 1
The first prototype was a proof of concept for cardboard based construction. It was missing a number of important features such as legs, motor mounts, battery mount and it did not have enough space for electronics. From this prototype we learned that cardboard was quite strong and that our initial arm design was going to work and provided enough strength. Using this prototype, we found that we could bolt our motors directly into the cardboard.

###Prototype 2
Our second prototype was fully functional design. It was capable of taking off, and landing reasonably well. When constructing this prototype we learned that we needed far better material for landing gear, as well as something to protect the propeller blades from hitting the ground. To solve these issues, we added foam landing pads to the feet, and bent wire to serve as prop guards. This was going to be our final prototype until it crashed. The crash showed us that all of our previous judgments where valid. Despite the copters violent thrashing, most of the frame was intact, and motors stayed bolted to the cardboard.

###Prototype 3
Our final prototype was made in less than one day. With design already done, we got parts cut and assembled it with 2 people over the course of 5 hours. This prototype is what we are currently using for our ground and air testing.
