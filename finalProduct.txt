Our Quadcopter got off the ground as shown in the videos below. We are still waiting for propellors to come from after the crash so that we can fly it again and continue to balance it so that it can fly stably. 

We have the electrical switch working to switch between the RC controller and the raspberry pi.

On the raspberry pi we currently have the ability to increase the throttle to a given power and turn the quadcopter in any direction. The quadcopter will respond both to a certain qr code number as well as the orientation of a qr code. Using these capabilities, we theoretically have the ability to center on a qr code, but we have not been able to test that capability without propellors. We have a gui mock-up in tkinter that allows us to communicate over our TCP network to send commands to the raspberry pi and in turn the flight controller board, which forwards the signal on to the ESCs and motors.
