===============
A team of engineering students building an autonomous quodcopter in *9 weeks* with under *$250*.

#Goals

##- Flight
We will need to balance the weight of the payload on the quadcopter with appropriate motors and a suitable battery such that it will be able to take off.

##- RC Control
In order to control our quodcopter when it's not flying autonomously, we will have RC override. 

##- Image Processing
The quodcopter will have an onboard webcam to survey its surroundings.
