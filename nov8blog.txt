Our first design review went very well last Monday and now we are ready to make a second, hopefully flyable, prototype. We added landing legs, a battery mount, wire slots, and a better motor mount as well as various minor tweaks to the original CAD.

The electrical system is also going well. We ordered connector pieces and are working on connecting the motors and ESCs (electronic speed controllers) to power.
