Flight Controller
-----------------

We purchased the HobbyKing Multi-Rotor Control Board V2.1 with an Atmega168PA microcontroller chip that is about 5cm squared and weighs 14.5g. This small board has both a gyroscope and accelerometer that will handle basic balancing of the quadcopter, allowing us to focus our efforts on both the mechanical construction and the autonomy aspects of our quadcopter.

To power our quadcopter, we have a 3300mAh 3-cell lithium polymer battery, that will give us about 8-10 minutes of flight. We have a regulator to allocate power both to our small electronics (raspberry pi and controller board) and our motors.

In addition to having autonomous control, we will have an RC override. We will mount an rc transmitter on our quadcopter, allowing us to use an RC receiver whenever we want to. This will allow us to test basic functionality such as turning, hovering, etc. without having to write the autonomy for simple testing.
