Computation
===========

Rasberry Pi
-----------
The main computation for our project takes place on a Rasberry Pi. This device is a small computer. It has 256 mb of ram and can be over-clocked to run at 1 GHz.

In its current form, it is running Raspbian, a distribution of linux based off of Debian. 

Our Pi will have a number of usb devices attached to it. The first is a wifi receiver. This will allow us to communicate over the internet as well as for it to stream data back to us. Secondly it has a webcamera attached.

OpenCV
------

Our device will also be running a program of our making to control the copter to do different things. This program will use OpenCV, a open source image processing library, to take input from the webcamera and react.

Our first steps in creating this program is to track QR code like images. These images will always be rectangular. Using OpenCV, we can locate our image inside
