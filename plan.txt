The Plan
=======

Goals
------

Our Initial vision at the start of the project was to have a quadcopter that could:

* Fly under RC control
* Fly autonomously
* Reliably switch to back to RC remotely with the controller
* Be small, we where hoping for smaller than a dinner plate.

After receiving feedback from our professor, we dropped the super small scale and added the ability to do on board image processing with a small Linux based computer called Raspberry Pi. Our copter will be able to preform basic actions such as following a qr code like object, landing in specific locations, stop moving when sensing lights.

And finally, the week before the due date, we have scaled back our goals in terms of what the image processing does.... FILL ME IN.
