The Process
===========

Goals
------

Our Initial vision at the start of the project was to have a quadcopter that could:

* Fly under RC control
* Fly autonomously
* Reliably switch to back to RC control remotely with the controller
* Be small- we where hoping for smaller than a dinner plate.

After receiving feedback from our professor, we dropped the super small scale and added the ability to do on board image processing with a small Linux based computer called a Raspberry Pi. We hoped to enable our quadcopter to preform basic actions such as following a QR code, landing in specific locations, and holding position when it has sensed a light. We planned to obtain the image processing aspect of our project by using the openCV libraries. We chose to use the c++ bindings for these libraries due to support and familiarity with the language. In addition to this, we wanted to have communication between the Raspberry Pi and our computers using wifi.

We dropped the goal of reacting to light a couple weeks into the project, because it did not relate well to our other goals. We decided that we would rather focus on having a robust and adaptable image processing system rather than trying to incorporate a photo resistor into the system.

The week before the due date we pivoted again and scaled back our goals in terms of the functionality of the image processing. Since we did not have a fliable quadcopter and therefore did not have the ability to test complex movement. Therefore, we decided to add some additional features to our code. We got up a client/server TCP network that allowed us to send commands to the raspberry pi from a computer, as well as making several proofs of concepts to control motor speed based on qr code id and positioning/angle.

Without the propellors we were not able to fully integrate the system into a fliable prototype with all expected capabilities, however, we did get all other systems integrated. The motors, ESCs, flight controller, raspberry pi, and rc receiver were all mounted on the frame. The raspberry pi successfully sent a pwm signal to the flight controller board, that in turn controls the motors. Finally, the switch to control whether rc controller or the raspberry pi was successfully implemented giving us the ability to switch between the two ways to pilot our quadcopter.


How we did
----------
We are quite happy with our final product. We successfully integrated all of the major components. We had a few roadblocks that we had to conquer, mainly propellers breaking and then getting lost in the mail, which delayed our schedule and made us not able to have a flying quadcopter by demo day, but hopefully we will have a flying quadcopter to demo soon.


What Didn't Go Well
-------------------
Our team, much like most POE teams, suffered from doing things last minute. During our original schedule, we were planning to be done a full two weeks before demo day. Some delays were outside of our control, such as long shipping times from China and replacement parts lost in mail. Other issues should have been considered from the start, crashing our quadcopter and having to rebuild. In general our team should have probably got to the integration phase of our project a little sooner.

Reflection
----------
Our team feels like working on this project was a great experience. Building a autonomous cardboard quadcopter was a lot of work, but very rewarding. Making a quadcopter for a class like Principles of Engineering is quite difficult both in budget and planning, and unlike many of the teams at Olin, we could not use existing materials or stockrooms to their full advantage. To make matters worse, the parts needed to make a quadcopter are hard to find, and to get them cheaply we had to order from China. Initially we placed a single order that totaled $200 out of our $250 budget with a large shipping cost.

The other thing that nobody in our group realized at the outset was how dangerous such a high powered flying object like a quadcopter could be. The motors we used are incredibly high power, each one uses 150-200 watts, which means our total power usage is over a half a horse power. To top it off, all of this power is concentrated in one hard-to-control, hard-to-turn-off object. This danger became incredibly evident to us after the our crash. We discovered that there is a bug in the control software that we where using, which causes all of the motors to turn on at their highest rate if the RC receiver does not receive a signal. When we were tuning the stabilization of our quadcopter after the full system was assembled, we made the mistake of turning off the RC controller before unplugging the battery powering the quadcopter, believing that it would be more safe to disable control entirely before approaching the quadcopter. Due to the fact that the quadcopter was tethered to the ground, when the motors wentt full on, all the quadcopter could do was thrash around on the ground. Our RC receiver's wires got cut almost immediately, and we were forced to wait until our propellers broke off and it was safe to approach the quadcopter and unplug the battery to power down the system. This really highlighted to us the need for safety when testing our quadcopter. We now are doubly careful about always having it tethered, testing it far away from people, and ensuring that all team members wear safety glasses when the propellors are on the quadcopter.

Materials Used
--------------

### On-Board ###

**Cardboard** from the recycling bin,

  The sheet we we used was 32"x20" with a thickness off around 4.1mm. A large clean box should do.

**RC Transmitter** from Drew Bennett, 1x

	We used the highly overkill [DX8 8CH Transmitter](http://www.spektrumrc.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=SPM8800) at $429.99. All you really need is 5 or more channels.

**3 cell Lipo Battery Charger + Power supply** from Drew Bennett's lab, 1x,

	Some way to charge your battery.


Estimated Cost
--------------
/*
14.56*4+11.90*4+2*4+12.99+9.99+1.99+26.72+3.77+1.65+2.99*2+3.64+1.59*2+25+12.74+13.06 +11.52 + 3.09= 249.16

*/
The minimum need parts assuming you have an avr programmer and an rc receiver and batter charger is: $249.16 not counting shipping.
/*
14.56*5+11.90*5+2*12+12.99+9.99+1.99+26.72+3.77+1.65*2+2.99*2+3.64+1.59*2+25+12.74+13.06+11.52 + 3.09 = 293.27

*/
In our testing, we found that parts break and its nice to have backups, thus we would suggest getting another motor and speed controller, more Servo Connectors, 2 more sets of props, a spare battery as well as some more cardboard. This would put the total up to $293.27.

//For our project, we had free access to wire, and some connectors, add this???
