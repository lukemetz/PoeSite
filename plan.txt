The Plan
=======

Goals
------

Our Initial vision at the start of the project was to have a quadcopter that could:

* Fly under RC control
* Fly autonomously
* Reliably switch to back to RC control remotely with the controller
* Be small- we where hoping for smaller than a dinner plate.

After receiving feedback from our professor, we dropped the super small scale and added the ability to do on board image processing with a small Linux based computer called a Raspberry Pi. We hoped to enable our quadcopter to preform basic actions such as following a QR code, landing in specific locations, and holding position when it has sensed a light.

We dropped the goal of reacting to light a couple weeks into the project, because it did not relate well to our other goals. We decided that we would rather focus on having a robust and adaptable image processing system rather than trying to incorporate a photoresistor into the system.

The week before the due date we pivoted again and scaled back our goals in terms of the functionality of the image processing.... FILL ME IN.
