Setting up the Raspberry Pi.
============================
We decided to use Rasbian, a distribution that is relatively easy to set up and meant for the pi. We decided to not install X for performance reasons, but got up a basic c++ tool chain, wifi connections using wicd, and ssh. We then installed many libraries, including OpenCV, and servoblaster. Due to the speed of the raspberry pi, this process is quite slow and takes many hours.

Tips for writing autonomous code
================================
Always write code on a computer. Due to the number of libraries we are using and the speed of the Raspberry Pi compile times are quite painful to debug with. In general, all code can be written on the computer, tested on the computer, and then uploaded to the Pi. Another more extreme option to minimize recompiles is to place all of the configuration values in an external file that can be changed at runtime.

As with all programming, start small and test. At least in our experience, the code can get quite complex very quickly and it helped a lot to make small tests.

Test your code! When writing image based autonomous code, its generally a good idea to run automated tests on your code. These tests take your code, and would run them in various virtual environments on a simulated quadcopter that behaves like the actual one. For our project we where not doing very complicated autonomy so we opted not to create this simulated environment. If your plan is to add more, we would strongly recommend creating a testing environment such as this.

Programming Flight Controller and ESC's
=======================================
The first thing we did when we got out flight controller was to reprogram it to use the kapteinkuk xcopter kk firmware. To do this, we used the [kkMulticopter Flashtool](http://lazyzero.de/en/modellbau/kkmulticopterflashtool). We went with the xwing configuration because we have a camera on board. The camera look forward if it is placed between two arms and not have to look through propeller blades.

To finish setting up the flight controller, follow the kk Quad x setup guide located at http://rcexplorer.se/educational/2011/02/kk-quad-x-setup-guide/. This guide walks you through testing and configuring the ESC and the flight controller.

Attach the Top Layer of Electronics
Bind the Transmitter to The RC Receiver
Use the manual that came with your RC transmitter and receiver for this task.

We used the anti-vibration mounting tape to secure the remaining electronics, but anything will do.

Tunning and Stabilization
=========================
Tunning our quad copter was quite difficult for us. To begin with, we neutral the potentiometers. Move the first and third pot to 50% and the second pot to 0%. In the firmware we are using the second pot is unused. To begin with, we tied down our quadcopter such that it could not fly away. We then used the RC controllers trim values to trim it level. This step takes a lot of time and tinkering with controls.

Once the copter is more or less level, use the first pot to adjust roll and pitch gains and then tune the 3rd pot until the copter flies straight.

Once you have configured your quadcopter, you are going to want to scope the output of the RC receiver such that you can emulate the tunning in the autonomous code.

While doing this step, we strongly recommend you tie down your quadcopter to prevent it from getting out of control.
This is an autonomous cardboard quadcopter driven by a Raspberry Pi. It is capable of wireless communication as well as well as real time image processing via camera.

Add on Propeller guards
We first bent thick wire into a U shape and inserted into the quadcopter frame. We chose to use hot glue for this due to its thickness.
